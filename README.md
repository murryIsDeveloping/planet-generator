# Planet Generator (Ray Lightyear)
Ray Lightyear's Intergalatic and Interdimensional real estate.

## Challenge
A planet generator that generates an (essentaily) infinite amount of planets. 
Planets can be modified and filtered by changing dimension.
Using React without stateful components, and with limited passing of props (hopefully none).

## Stack
The application uses React, rxjs for streaming state and events and three.js for rendering the models.

## Notes
Planets can be generated using the 'space' bar (pun intended) by clicking the message bar at the bottom of the screen, or on mobile divices by tapping the planet rendering. Custom planets can be generated by typing any name into the planet input field in the toolbar.

Dimensions change properties of the planet or create filtering rules. By changing the dimension name (hexadecimal characters only) the planets generated will alter slightly or may be filtered out.
